KEYSTONE SPEECHMASTER SOLO,,"KeyStone SpeechMaster is a voice input text editor program and voice output screen reader program and spell check utility designed for use by individuals with learning disabilities. The system integrates voice recognition technology (Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional software; see separate entry) with a text-to-speech screen reader (KeyStone ScreenSpeaker) and a spelling and homophone checker. The program reads enrolment scripts in small phrases for the user to repeat, making it unnecessary for users to read a single word in order to set up voice input. For voice input, the user dictates into a microphone attached to a computer. Speech is converted into text and displayed on the screen using Microsoft Word. The program then speaks out the text in its own clear computer-generated voice so that the user can determine whether the correct words have been displayed. When a correction is needed, the program speaks the displayed alternatives. If the correct text is heard among the options, it can be chosen with a voice command like Choose 3. The program's spelling and homophone checking functions and screen reader can be started as dictation proceeds	 or on completion. Where questions arise detailed help is supplied both on-screen and audibly. A hot-line telephone and e-mail service is also available.",Words Worldwide Ltd,N/A,http://www.wordsworldwide.co.uk
