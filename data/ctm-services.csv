National Tour of Wales and England
17th May—15th July 2006

Featuring Sarah Gordy—a professional actress with Down's syndrome

A new play set in the 1930s in the house of rich aristocratic family Lord and Lady Webb, where hierarchy is strong and you know your place.

Mary, a new young maid, joins the kitchen staff in the lowest position in the house. Mary is seen as someone with no hope of advancement or marriage, in complete contrast to the beautiful but wilful daughter of the house - Miss Leonora.

Resisting the demarcation of society, and with the help of a good friend, Mary rises above all expectations…

Perceptions will be challenged, obstacles will be overcome, and prejudices will be re-evaluated in this thought-provoking tale of breaking out.

As well as affordable, bespoke, hands-on filmmaking which has become the company’s trademark, Support Media also has an expanding range of services including:

•	TRAINING  - enabling staff and service users to see where video could be used in their services and lives. Then learn how to plan, script, film and edit their own films and produce DVDs.
•	DVD LEAFLETS – an affordable option in the development of accessible information, which uses your existing written promotional material (no filming required) and presents it in a self playing, narrated DVD with music and stills. Ideal for service providers with stands at conferences and exhibitions to hand out to those people who cannot access written documents.
•	CONFERENCE SUPPORT – Support Media has developed the VIDEO BOX, a ‘big brother diary-room’ style area where conference and exibition delegates can enter and be supported to record their thoughts and feelings. The end of tick boxes and inaccessible questionnaires?

You will have the opportunity to work with children and adults with learning disability in their home, school or working environment.

Learning disability nursing requires a high level of skill and resourcefulness. Its objective is the enablement of people who have a learning disability, so that they can participate fully in all aspects of community life. The programme is based on the principle that all people have physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs and are therefore unique and dynamic individuals with inherent potential for growth and development.Studying learning disability nursing will introduce you to a range of issues related to the provision of health and social care services for people with a learning disability. Learning disability nurses straddle the health and social care divide, which is reflected in the curriculum. 

The first year provides an introduction to human physiology and anatomy, and a foundation in important aspects of learning disability nursing. You will also start to acquire the professional skills you will need in an inter-professional context. 

Advanced modules in Years 2 and 3 build on this foundation and cover a range of topics including physical and mental health needs, advocacy, choice, therapeutic relationships and interventions, social policy, cultural issues, social policy, diversity and inclusion, law and ethics, management and transitions to professional practice.
